# Woo Commerce API testing framework for python using pytest

This is the repo where I am building the project myself.

This project tests the woo commerce API using pytest.

This woocommerce wordpress site is running on my local machine in docker.

## Setting up the same dev environment

Just install docker and docker-compose on your local system.

Create a directory and put this docker-compose.yml file in it.

Then from that directory run

  docker-compose up
  
You will have wordpress, mysql, and phpmyadmin set up on your local system.
